# Welcome to the Logic CSS framework ! #

**CURRENT STATUS UPDATE:** refactoring has started, soon there will be a fresh release, check back soon !

## Introduction ##

The Logic CSS framework is a collection of CSS files and a toolset designed to
cut development times for web-standards compliant web layouts and templates.

## Main features ##

  * Common cross-browser rendering behavior approach (not a reset).
  * Beautiful font stacks.
  * Typography with text resizing capabilities and vertical baseline/rhythm.
  * Three totally flexible layout grid templates, customizable with the toolset.
    * Elastic layout using EMs.
    * Liquid layout with percentages.
    * Fixed layout using pixel dimensions.

## Planned features ##

  * Design patterns implementations and Microformats styling.
  * Easy to use, beautiful web palettes.
  * Forms and tables styles.
  * Wordpress base theme implementation ala Sandbox.
  * Many others...

## What's in the box ##

The main contents of the `logicss/` directory are:

  * **`common.css`** which sets common values for styles since our objective is to have consistent rendering thru common browsers.
  * **`typography/*.css`** these apply typography styles to content.
  * **`font/*.css`** defines or mixes font families for page elements.
  * **`grid/*.css`** gives you the ability to use grids to layout your design.
  * other directories are actually to be considered _EXPERIMENTAL_.

## The utilities in `tools/` ##

For now, only the Grid Builder is available but there's also a semantic-aid tool in the works.
